# Graph Theory

This repository contains some of most used graphs theory algorithms such graph traversing, shortest path, maximum flow problem, minimum spanning trees and others.

All algorithms are implemented in Java programming language.

* GraphTraverse: contains two graph traversing algorithms: depth-first-search & breadth-first-search.

* CycleDetection: algorithm for cycle detection.

* Dijkstra & BellmanFord: shortest path algorithms.

* Kruskal & Prim: minimum spanning trees algorithms.

* Kosaraju: algorithm to determine strongly connected components.

* FordFulkerson: maximum flow problem.

* TopologicalOrder: determine grph topological order.
